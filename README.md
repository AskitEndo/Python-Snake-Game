Welcome to the Python 3 Snake Game implemented using the Turtle library in a Jupyter Notebook!

## Introduction

This Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food pellets. The objective is to maneuver the snake around the screen without colliding with the walls or itself while eating food to score points.

## Features

- Classic arcade-style gameplay.
- Control the snake using keyboard arrow keys (W, S, A, D).
- The snake grows longer and moves faster as it consumes food.
- Randomly appearing hazards (fppf) add an extra challenge to the game.
- Beautifully designed using the Turtle library in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already (`pip install notebook`).
4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`).
6. Open the `Snake_Game.ipynb` file.
7. Run the notebook and enjoy playing the Snake Game!

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (W, S, A, D) to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the green food pellets to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid running into the walls or colliding with your own tail.
- Beware of the red hazards (fppf) that appear randomly, as they will end the game upon collision.
